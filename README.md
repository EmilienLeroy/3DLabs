# 3D Labs

Welcome to my 3D Labs! This repository is a collection of personal 3D models that I have created to train myself in the field of 3D design. All the models available here are free to use, and there are no conditions or restrictions imposed on their usage.

## Accessing the Models

You can explore and access the 3D models created in these labs by visiting the website [labs.emilienleroy.fr](https://labs.emilienleroy.fr). The website provides a convenient way to browse and view the various models available.

## Model Creation Process

The primary tool I utilize for creating each model is called Blockbench. Blockbench is a powerful 3D modeling software that enables me to design intricate and detailed models efficiently.
